<h1> Call Center Training Tips</h1>

<h2> Work Projects</h2>

<p>I'm a shy person by nature. Back in 2005 I attempted to get a job in a call center. I failed. </p>
<p>After a few months of failure, practice, taking notes, interviewing others I learned how to qualify and received job offers. In the process, I took notes. Lots of notes. </p>
<p>I shared my notes with three of my friends and all of them got hired in a call center.</p>
<p>I shared my notes with an entrepreneur and it was used as a basis to write a call center training program and start a call center training school. I also became an assistant to said entrepreneur and played the roal of a teacher and a recruiter and an officer for the call center as our operations grew. </p>
<p>In the process we helped a few thousand people land call center jobs. Notable accomplishments were assisting students who were experiencing various challenges in getting an employment in a call center. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some students have limited education: Didn't finish college or only finished high school. </li>
  <li>Some had no confidence and felt they were only entitled to low paying jobs: Trycicle Drivers, Taxi Drivers, Store Sales Clerks, etc.</a></li>
  <li>Some were retirees who were looking for an income source.</li>
  <li>Some where full time moms who wanted to assist the family income stream.</li>
  <li>Some were people who simply didn't have confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time as people asked for my help, I decided to encode my notes into a blog and eventually a book and I help several people get hired in a call center.</p>

<h1> Call Center Training Tips</h1>

<h2>About the project:</h2>

<p>I'm a shy person by nature.</p>
<p>In 2005 I attempted to get a job in a call center and failed.</p>
<p>My dad told me that I'm doomed and my mom told me that I should get a low paying job.</p>
<p>Fearing a life of low paying jobs, I refused to give up and committed to learn.</p>
<p>I took notes, lots of notes.</p>
<p>After months of trial and error, learning techniques to overcome my shyness, interviewing others, I eventually got my first job offer.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of other companies and got job offers as well. I finally, understood the secrets of how to get job offer in a call center. </p>
<p>I shared my notes with three of my friends and all of them got hired in a call center.</p>
<p>I shared my notes with an entrepreneur and it was used as a basis to write a call center training program and start a call center training school. I also became an assistant to said entrepreneur and played the roal of a teacher and a recruiter and an officer for the call center as our operations grew. </p>
<p>In the process we helped a few thousand people land call center jobs. Notable accomplishments were assisting students who were experiencing various challenges in getting an employment in a call center. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some students have limited education: Didn't finish college or only finished high school. </li>
  <li>Some had no confidence and felt they were only entitled to low paying jobs: Trycicle Drivers, Taxi Drivers, Store Sales Clerks, etc.</a></li>
  <li>Some were retirees who were looking for an income source.</li>
  <li>Some where full time moms who wanted to assist the family income stream.</li>
  <li>Some were people who simply didn't have confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time as people asked for my help, I spent a lot of drinking sessions coaching strangers on how to get hired in a call center. </p>
<p>To decrease the time I spend coaching and extend my help to others, I encoded my notes into a blog and eventually, wrote a book on the topic.</p>
<p>My efforts resulted in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a blog with 3,000 monthly visitors.</li>
  <li>A facebook page with 3,400 followers.</li>
  <li>An email list with a thousand subscribers.</li>
  <li>Hundreds of heartfelt emails and messages from the people I've inspired.</li>
</ul>
  <p>The blog is currently down because I'm migrating out of wordpress. Let me know if you need help and I'll send you some articles.</p>

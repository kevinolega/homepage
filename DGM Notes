Chris Translates the emails
Joha sends the emails using Aweber

We need to send two messages.

Two ways to check:
1. Aweber - Login and check the broadcast 
2. Gmail - Ours

One way to do it is to get this done by bulk.

"don't overthink things.  Just follow what i said earlier

polite coldness, make her miss you"


Hi Joha,

I'll also help out with this task.

Joha returns 

June 11 or something


Check the support email for Brandon with Joha. 


We don't send refunds through email.

We send them the instructions on how to get the refund on clickbank.

Got you on this. We will make this the top priority.

We will replace the article listing template adn will be applying the changes on the next update.

What template are we going to use for the course page?




why are the posts on this page side by side: http://tsbmag.cheueyphp.com/category/dating-relationships/

I'm assuming that it is supposed to be: http://hitsdesignclients.com/TSB/article_listing.php

::: okay will replace it to the article listing template...

The courses page, will be image and brief description of the course, but then will link to a sales page

::: 

We are currently investigating the problem it seems the system processed the cancel but Recurly didn't receive the request. 

We will send you an update with more information as soon as we discover the cause.

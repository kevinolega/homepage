### Questions?

**All Level's Class**

	+ Trap the arm on the same side that you're escaping toward.
	+ Take the back
	+ Transition to north south bear hug
	+ Remember to keep your chest connected to your partner's back.
	+  Drill: Go back and forth with partner
-  Side Control Escape
-  Side Control Escape to Forward Sweep 1
-  Side Control Escape to Forward Sweep 2
-  Side Control Escape to Reverse Sweep

**Roll**
- Partner 1
	+ Was able to pass guard after partner's triangle attempt but wasn't able to maintain position.
	+ Unable to catch partner with kimura
	+ Escape side control by rolling but ended up in a compormised back position.
- Partner 2
	+ Pushing weight down when partner attempted triangle.
	+ Was able to pass guard but unable to maintain position.
	+ Ended up putting partner in closed guard and holding until the end.
	+ Was unable to catch partner with kimura.
	+ Wrist lock and submission attempts are ineffective if you forget to pull them with their legs to break their posture. You can't muscle people into a lock or submission.
- Partner 3
	+ Parner helped me work on my guard pass to side control.
	+ I can't push the leg up if partner's leg is hooked onto me in some form.
	+ Ran out of stamina and unable to continue.
- Partner 4
	+ Held closed guard until time ran out.
	+ Forgot to break posture before attempted submission.
	+ Wristlock distraction to kimura seems to be effective if you break the posture (I did not break the posture) also attempted it while in closed guard and hanging from my partner.
	+ Eventually ran out of stamina and fell under side control.
	+ Attempted to use the side control escape that we learned recently.
	+ Unable to escape side control and time ran out.

- From Side Control: Kesa Gatame to Breadcutter

### Questions?

* Questions Go Here


### Wishlist

- Breadcutter from side control (without the need to enter NS)
- Kesa Gatame (from side control). I'd like to figure out all sorts of subs and counters to counters.
- Kimura (from closed guard). I'd like to get used to the different grips and subtle positions.
- Cross collar choke (from closed guard) get used
- Full Guard Chokes

### Bad Habits

- Will attempt Sankyo wristlock while escaping RNC. Will hold on to the wristlock instead of pushing and escaping.
- Will attempt to dive for submissions from bad positions
	+ Will attempt Ezekiel inside closed guard
	+ Will attempt Ezekiel from top half guard
	+ Will attempt Ezekiel from bottom half guard
	+ Will attempt sloppy punch choke under full mount
	+ Will dive for baseball choke
		* From standing
		* Closed Guard
		* Full Mount
	+ Will attempt wristlock from anywhere
- Will allow triangle and armbar then attempt to escape

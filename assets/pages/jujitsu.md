**Roll**
- Partner 1
	+ Was able to pass guard after partner's triangle attempt but wasn't able to maintain position.
	+ Unable to catch partner with kimura
	+ Escape side control by rolling but ended up in a compormised back position.

	+ Pushing weight down when partner attempted triangle.
	+ Was able to pass guard but unable to maintain position.
	+ Ended up putting partner in closed guard and holding until the end.
	+ Was unable to catch partner with kimura.
	+ Wrist lock and submission attempts are ineffective if you forget to pull them with their legs to break their posture. You can't muscle people into a lock or submission.

	+ Parner helped me work on my guard pass to side control.
	+ I can't push the leg up if partner's leg is hooked onto me in some form.

	+ Wristlock distraction to kimura seems to be effective if you break the posture (I did not break the posture) also attempted it while in closed guard and hanging from my partner.
	+ Eventually ran out of stamina and fell under side control.
	+ Attempted to use the side control escape that we learned recently.
	+ Unable to escape side control and time ran out.

### 2022-10-01-Saturday

Couldn’t go to Open Mat. Practiced moving with elbows open guard. Still had a difficult time maintaining proper open guard position.

### 2022-09-30-Friday

**Beginner’s Class:**

1. Open Guard: Moving with your elbows
2. Open Guard: Maintaining
3. Open Guard: Technical Stand-Up

Notes:
- I need to get used to holding the guard position longer.
- I can rock back and forth to conserve energy
- Remember to breathe
- Pull your knees closer, so you don’t expend as much energy. Holding your legs out longer exhausts your core faster. Only extend your legs if you need to. 

- [ ] Coach Mike encouraged me to strengthen my core. Hollow rock, leg raise, L-Sit

Note: Open mat is free. Doesn’t use up my 12 sessions.

### 2022-09-29-Thursday

**No-Gi**

1. Attacking Turtle: Getting into a hip-to-hip position
	+ Remember to keep your outside foot away as you pivot.
	+ Do not kneel.
	+ Apply your body weight to your partner.

2. Attacking Turtle: Getting into a hip-to-hip position → Putting your outside leg into their pocket, then pulling his outside leg to get to the back.
	+ Pull the arm and shrimp to get to the back.

3. Standing Collar Tie: Both pulling the neck down: Disengage using forearm →  Take the back ball and socket grip.

4. Standing Collar Tie: Both pulling the neck down: Duck down and take single-leg while pushing with head.
- Remember to push with your head.

Rolling: 
- Got caught with side control Americana
- Got caught in side control armbar
- Partner held turtle position to let me work on technique 2.
- Don’t attempt to muscle your way out of a technique if you have a strength advantage.
- Partner seems most vulnerable to push counter when they attempt full mount. Doesn't work too well after one successful attempt. Consumes too much stamina.  However, find a way to not get stuck in north-south

### Questions?

* Setup → Position → Submission? Does this apply to all techniques?

### Issues

* I only have one side-control escape.
* I only have one escape from under full mount.
* Basic submissions aren't muscle memory yet. Need more drilling. 
* Beginners can interrupt me and cancel my submission attempt while I'm trying to remember the next step of the submission.
* I attempt submissions from the wrong positions (often when the position changes I commit to a submission I decided on)

### Missing from my Jiujitsu.

* Escaping back take
* What to do from turtle
* Second mount escape

## Traps

* From full-mount: Allow sweep to get a Kimura from guard.

### Move List

### Jujitsu Log

**Beginner:**

1. Americana from Mount
	* Hold the wrist and elbow when the partner defends → Drop your weight.
	* C-grip (no thumbs)
	* Slide free arm from under the triceps to complete the lock
2. Armbar from Mount

	* Slide one knee to close to the partner's head
	* Keep your weight on your partner
	* Push down (Push up)
	* Legs will make an S-position
		- Keep the weight on the partner by balancing forward as you have a tendency to pull all the weight backward leaving your front open with zero pressure when you move your legs into position.
	* Hug both your partner's arms.
	* Place your other leg on top of your partner → Secure the shoulder and apply armbar.
3. Americana from mount variation partner straightens the arm.

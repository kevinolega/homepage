This is what my typical week looks like.

**monday**  I'm working. I say no to all invitations.

**tuesday**  I'm working. I say no to all invitations.

**wednesday**  I'm working but may be available in the afternoon.

**thursday**  I'm running errands today but I may be open to a short meeting.

**friday**  I am running errands today but may be open to a meeting within my location or online.

**saturday**  Saturday is training day for me but may be available in the afternoon.

**sunday**  I'm spending time with family, playing with my dog, biking, drawing, going to church and seeing family.

**how to reach me:**

The best way to stay in touch is [joining my email list where I send my updates](https://sendfox.com/kevinolega).

You can send me an email and tell me what you need and I'll reply when I'm logged in.

If you need to reach me for something urgent, you can send me a text message and I'm going to reply or call you back when I'm available.

Mondays to Wednesdays are usually crazy busy and Friday is difficult to leave Para√±aque. 

That's the reason I do most things online.

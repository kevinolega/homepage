Hi there!

You love your kid, but you're not getting along.

Teenage hormones often trigger rebellious adolescent behavior.

Your son will mature and see things from your point of view...eventually.

It was too late in my case.

I could tell that my dad wanted to tell me more, but I was the black sheep of the family.

I only got close to him when he had very little time left.

I propose a solution.

Let's document the most important things that you want to tell your son that you're not ready to discuss with them in person right now.

I'll help you write the message if you need some guidance.

The most valuable gift that I received from my dad is his wisdom.

Nobody can steal it.

My dad often pictured a scenario where I was standing over his grave complaining about how he didn't teach me enough and that many things he told me would only make sense to me after he's dead whenever we had disagreements.

Dad had a military-style upbringing, so he thought it was best to sear painful lessons into a teenage me, so I knew how to survive.

My dad doesn't know that I journaled about many of our arguments. 

I have a reference for many of the lessons and not just the painful ones.

My dad taught me more than he thought he did.

The teenage me couldn't see and thought that my dad was just an asshole behaving like a villain from a fictional story.

But the 35-year-old me could tell that my dad desperately wanted to teach me out of love despite being clumsy with his choice of words.

Relationships are complex, and I now understand that many fathers are under a lot of pressure, but I sincerely wished that dad put many of these lessons in writing.

99% of all the things I hated my dad for eventually made sense to me when I hit thirty.

I wish that dad had a blog or a journal with all the lessons I could read now that I needed the information.

I didn't get to ask about a bunch of stuff because I didn't care about the topics back then, but I find it incredibly useful now that I'm older.

You probably have the paperwork of your businesses, assets, insurance money ready for transfer when you pass away.

However, what I crave the most now that I'm older is my dad's advice.

I reached out because I felt it would be worth that to spare your family of this pain.

Enough talk.

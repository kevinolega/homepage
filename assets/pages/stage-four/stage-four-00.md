Please click the sentence that matches your current situation.

You and your son are not on speaking terms right now because he is in a rebellious adolescent phase.

[You love him, but there are days when you'd love to strangle him](https://olega.org/s4-01).

You are generally civil but occasionally argue over creative differences.

Your son knows the rules of engagement but occasionally requires some reminders.

You and your son are generally okay but you sometimes feel frustrated that he's not paying attention to what you say and you're worried about his future.

Your relationship is incredibly smooth. You're both always on the same page and can almost finish each other's sentences.

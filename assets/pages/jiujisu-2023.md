### Issues

* I only have two side-control escapes.
* I only have one escape from under full mount.
* Basic submissions aren't muscle memory yet. Need more drilling. 
* Beginners can interrupt me and cancel my submission attempt while I'm trying to remember the next step of the submission.
* I attempt submissions from the wrong positions (often when the position changes I commit to a submission I decided on)

### Missing from my Jiujitsu.

* Escaping back take
* What to do from turtle
* Second mount escape

## History

* Session 50 as of May 5, 2023.
* Competed April 5, 2023

Hello there!

Welcome to my about page.

I share my history and past activities on this page.

Please visit my [Now Page to find out what I'm doing now](https://olega.org/now)

### SUMMARY

I enjoy writing and making things on the web since 2005.

I have a mix of different skills and interests.

### FREELANCE WORK

* I work as a digital project manager. I help entrepreneurs implement their business ideas. I oversee the creation and development of websites, apps, and digital marketing campaigns. 
* I previously worked as a virtual assistant.
* I ghostwrote articles for diverse websites, covering topics related to fitness, health, and personal development in areas such as education, finance, creativity, sports, outdoors, travel, fitness, and health.

### ONLINE WRITING

**Minimal Changes Blog:** In 2010, I launched [Minimal Changes](http://minimalchanges.com), a website where I document my personal experiments in developing a minimalist lifestyle. I share strategies I've tested on myself to achieve free time, spare cash, a clear head, and effortless productivity. It's been an exciting journey!

**Philippine Island Living Blog:** I love traveling, trying new foods, and capturing memories through photography. That's why I created Philippine Island Living, a website where I share my adventures and the things I enjoy about life in the Philippines. In 2020, I decided to rebrand the website to help promote local businesses and service providers. You can visit the website at [philippineislandliving.com](http://philippineislandliving.com).

**Call Center Training Tips:** I started [Call Center Training Tips](https://callcentertrainingtips.com) because my friends frequently asked me for advice on how to get hired in a call center. Despite being an introvert, I've been working in the BPO industry since 2007 and improved my communication skills, which my friends found impressive. I enjoy teaching people, especially those who struggle with shyness like me. As demand grew, I realized that I was spending too much time giving advice in person, so I decided to create an online platform where people can access comprehensive lessons and tutorials. Call Center Training Tips provides training in communication and customer service, preparing students to land high-paying jobs in the call center industry. Additionally, I offer personalized mentoring to dedicated students to help them achieve their career goals.

### PERSONAL PREFERENCE AND PHILOSOPHY

* I try to approach difficult tasks with a gameful mindset. Many of my wins are a result of this strategy. Anything I take too seriously ends in failure.
* I do my best to live like a minimalist, I focus on owning less and making sure every item I own fits my strategy and preferred lifestyle.
* Health has become a priority for me. I'm making a concious effort to sleep eight hours a day, drink water and [exercise](https://philippineislandliving.com/prcity) everyday.
* I've been exploring the Slow-Carb, Ketogenic, Paleo, [Carnivore](http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/) and Atkins diet as well as intermittent fasting and documenting my progress. I eat mostly meat and vegetables and I do my best to limit carbs, sugar and starchy food intake five to six days a week.
* Whenever I can, I cook my own food.

### FITNESS

I'm a fitness enthusiast who loves CrossFit, cycling and martial arts.

* I walk my dogs for about an hour daily.
* I follow a 5x5 strength protocol for squats, presses, and deadlifts.
* I also practice kettlebell swings and turkish getups.
* I slowly do bodyweight exercises like <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/grapplerfit">burpees, air squats, pull ups, and toes to bar</a>.
* I enjoy riding my bike. I take my [folding bike](http://philippineislandliving.com/giant-fd806-folding-bike-review/) around the city or my mountain bike for long rides out of town. I also assembled a [fixed gear bike](https://philippineislandliving.com/fixed-gear/).
* I practice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olegajitsu/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> twice a week.

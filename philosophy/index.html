<h2>About Kevin Olega</a></h2>
<p>I enjoy writing and making things on the web.</p>
<p>I started making websites in 2005.</p>
<p>I worked in sales and marketing.</p>
<p>I have a mix of different skills and interests.</p>
<p>In 2010, I started a blog named <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">minimal changes</a> about my personal experiments to develop free time, spare cash, a clear head and lighter living by applying minimalist lifestyle expriments and by testing counter intuitive strategies on myself. It's been a wild ride.</p>
<p>I'm from the Philippines and I enjoy travel and trying out food. Occassionaly, I take lots of pictures. I started a website named <a href="http://philippineislandliving.com">Philippine Island Living</a> to share tips and stories about my adventures and the things I enjoy about life in the Philippines.</p>
<p>I worked in the BPO industry since 2007 my friends have been asking me for tips on how to get hired in a call center. I'm an introvert. People who know me growing up know it that's why they ask me for tips because they couldn't believe the improvement. I enjoy teaching people because I know the challenges of people who are shy or have difficulty communiting. I enjoy helping shy people like me. Over time I realized that I've been spending a bit too much time doing this so I decided to set up a website and write all my lessons instead of spending a few hours with them teaching them all I know over beer or food. <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips is an online reference to help people get hired in a call center</a>.</p>

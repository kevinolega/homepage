My work involves a combination of project management and creative work.

That said, my work requires extreme focus.

I thrive when I get long periods of uninterrupted silence to sit and think.

The opposite is also true.

I perform poorly when I'm distracted.

My work feels like driving for me.

My tasks requires both my hands and undivided attention.

Using my phone becomes both illegal and dangerous when driving.

I've had many projects fail because I got distracted.

I don't want to fail again.

To avoid failure, I need to maintain my focus.

My solution is:

I avoid reading all news.

I log out of social media.

I turn off notifications.

I don't participate in events and discussion.

[I say no to almost everything](https://kevinolega.com/n/).

I ignore chats and calls while I'm working.

I do my work in seclusion.

When I'm done working, I reach out to everyone who contacted me.

In case I ignored your message, I'm not angry or upset at you.

I'm just trying to finish some work.

Thank you for your kind understanding.

Kevin

<h3>fitness</h3>
<p>I've been doing most of my workouts at home since the Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>I'm just going slow. I'm doing <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/tabata">Tabata exercises</a> at 60-70% capacity for about 30 minutes to develop my exercise consistency.</p>
<p>I purchased a barbell and squat rack so I follow a 5 x 5 protocol for presses, squats and deadlifts.</p>
<p>I'd like to try boxing and Jiujitsu after the pandemic.</p>

<h3>fitness</h3>
<p>I've been exercising at home since the lockdown.</p>
<p>I got a barbell plus squat rack, for presses, squats, and deadlifts to follow the 5x5 strength protocol.</p>
<p>I slowly do <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/grapplerfit">twenty five burpees and air squats</a> so I can try boxing and Jiu-jitsu after the pandemic.</p>

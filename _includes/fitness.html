<h3>fitness</h3>
<p>I've been exercising at home since the lockdown.</p>
<p>I follow a 5x5 strength protocol for squats, presses, and deadlifts. I also practice kettlebell swings and turkish getups.</p>
<p>I slowly do <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/grapplerfit">twenty five burpees, air squats, and toes to bar</a> so I can try boxing and Jiujitsu after the pandemic.</p>

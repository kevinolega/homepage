<h3>fitness</h3>
<p>I've been doing most of my workouts at home since the Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>I'm just going slow.</p> 
<p>I'm following a <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/grapplerfit">simple workout program</a> because I'd like to try boxing and Jiujitsu after the pandemic.</p>
<p>I purchased a barbell and squat rack, and follow a 5 x 5 protocol for presses, squats and deadlifts.</p>

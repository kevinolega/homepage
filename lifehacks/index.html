<h2>Lifehacks used by Kevin Olega</a></h2>

<strong>Time</strong>
<p>Make "no" your default response to requests.</p>
<p>If an opportunity requires you to make a decision today, the answer is no.</p>

<strong>Money</strong>
<p>Instead of paying money for data when you commute home, pay for better trainsportation options.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for. The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price has been forgotten.</p>

<strong>Food</strong>
<p>Buy water and chicharon to stay keto outside.</p>
<p>Ketogenic Diet Quicklist, Chicharon, Butter, Coconut Oil, Pork, Broccoli, Sardines.</p>


<strong>Getting Things Done</strong>
<p>Little progress and continuty.</p>
<p>Faster options are often traps.</p>
<p>Eight hours of sleep is the ultimate performance enhancer.</p>
<p>The metaphors that you use to describe your life influence your thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>The formula for failure is overcommitting and overexerting.</p>
<p>Effortless output comes from a cheerful and playful attitude.<p>
<p>The slow track is the real fast track.</p>
<p>Today has enough challenges to require you to place all your focus in it. Placing your attention on the future is another distraction. Focus on doing today well.</p>


<strong>Happiness</strong>
<p>Goals related to being the person you want to be and doing things that you want to do are exponentially more satisfying and affordable than goals related to the ownership of enviable things.</p>
<p>Life is a gift. That includes every problem.</p>
<p>Life is 90% blessing and 10% learning</p>
<p>Negative emotions are signals to take action.</p>
<p>There is little need to rush because we are all heading toward the grave.</p>

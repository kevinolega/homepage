### work

I do project management for a US-based web design firm and a career transition consulting business.

I also work part time for a [local CrossFit gym](http://prcitycf.com/).

I operate from Quezon City and Parañaque City.

I write articles for different fitness, productivity, education, financial and creativity blogs.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals. [This picture represents my tasks and commitments at the moment.][1]

### projects

I write [job hunting tips for aspiring BPO workers][2] and occasionally teach English.

I'm attempting to declutter and [sell all of my possessions on my online store][3].

I'm rewriting my old posts on my [Minimal Changes blog][4] as a part of my life review and because my 2010-2015 writing was really horrible and cringe-worthy. Don't get me wrong, the principles of what I wanted to say at the time, is really profound and I sincerely wanted to make the changes I have written down, but at the time, I also lacked the patience and attention span to express myself well and now that I've improved a little, I'm reviewing each post and giving it another shot.

### personal

I'm preparing for a [local bike event][5] this November 2018.

[I have a dog now][6] and I'm learning how to fit caring for my pet into my schedule.

I spend most of my free time cycling, [CrossFit][7], [blogging][8], [drawing][9] and learning how to make meditation a daily practice.

I'm currently experimenting with the [Carnivore Diet](http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/) and only eat beef, lamb, chicken and seafood between September 15 and December 15, 2018.

I geek out on almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[I moved my recommendations to its own page.][10]

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers’ /now page][11] movement. Check it out at [nownownow.com][12].

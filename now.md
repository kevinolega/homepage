### work

I manage projects for a US-based career and HR consulting business.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals.

I am grateful I get to work from home. 

I operate from Parañaque City.

### projects

I'm often writing and reflecting on my journal or tinkering with website code.

I'm beginning to see myself slowly opt out participating in social media and corporate cloud services.

Surrendering my personal information in exchange for free services no longer feels like a good trade.

I'm going back to my roots and reviewing CSS and JavaScript.

I'm also reading up on PostgreSQL.

My website is the definitive source of information about me and the work I'm doing.

I [sell English lessons](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/6WEL250/) and write [career advice for BPO workers][1] and  as part of my community service.

### fitness

Since the Covid-19 lockdown I've been doing [Tabata exercises](https://minimalchanges.com/tabata) at 60-70% of my capacity for about 30 minutes to develop my exercise consistency.

### personal

[My dog][4] is [now a father](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/) and I'm now caring two pets as part of my schedule.

I'm renting a small apartment that doubles as an office and exercise space.

I spend my free time [cycling][5], [blogging][7] and [drawing][8].

I avoid consuming carbs, sugar and eat mostly [beef][9].

I geek out on anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[Stay in touch with me by joining my personal mailing list.][10]

### work

I manage projects for a US-based web design firm and a career transition consulting business.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals. [This picture represents my tasks and commitments at the moment.][1]

I operate from [The Common Space][2] Parañaque City.

### projects

I write [career advice for aspiring BPO workers][3] as part of my community service.

I'm attempting to declutter and [sell all of my possessions on my online store][4].

A few weeks ago, I bought access to a bunch of books and online courses including copywriting, email marketing, drawing and web design.

### personal

[I have a dog now][5] and I'm learning how to fit caring for my pet into my schedule.

I spend most of my free time [cycling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdlqCqkHHJ8/), [CrossFit][8], [blogging][9], [drawing][10] and learning how to make meditation a daily practice.

I'm currently on the fifteenth attempt of my experiment with the [Carnivore Diet][11] and only eat beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood. My first attempt was between September 15 and December 15, 2018. I have been on and off and just getting back on again.

I geek out on pens, bikes, tech, fitness, philosophy, and almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and J-pop idols.

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers’ /now page][12] movement. Check it out at [nownownow.com][13].

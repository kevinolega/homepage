### work

I work from [the Common Space](https://www.thecommonspace.ph) in Parañaque City, Philippines.

I enable entrepreneurs to cut their work hours, by offloading their repetitive and time consuming tasks and personally managing their business and personal projects.

I write articles for different fitness, productivity, education, financial and creativity blogs.

I'm currently not accepting work and business proposals. [Here's a picture of what my task list looks like right now.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yjNUrU0n9nNWXYU03)

### projects

I'm currently exploring the creation and editing of videos. A sample will be available at [my call center tips job application website](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/basics).

At the final stage of creating a website for [Teacher Barbara, a professional private Filipino English tutor](http://philippinesprivateenglishtutors.com/).

### personal

I spend most of my free time cycling, [CrossFit](http://prcitycf.com/), blogging, [drawing](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikZWBgSuOOxXMjaD3) and tinkering with tech.

I buy way more notebooks and pens than I should.

I geek out on almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and jpop idols.

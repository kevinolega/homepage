<h3>work</h3>
<p>I work as a digital project manager, overseeing the creation and development of websites and digital marketing campaigns. My role includes optimizing email newsletters, social media, and video services to grow audiences, conducting SEO keyword research, and planning and creating content to enhance search engine rankings.</p>
<p><a href="https://olega.org/n/">I'm not accepting additional work and business proposals</a>.</p>
<p>I operate from Metro Manila.</p>
<h3>projects</h3>
<p>I created <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a> with the mission of helping low-income Filipinos acquire basic job skills and become financially secure. Through the website and video tutorials, I provide comprehensive training in communication and customer service, preparing students to qualify for high-paying jobs. In addition, I offer personalized mentoring to dedicated students, helping them achieve their career goals.</p>
<p>I'm working on improving my skills in project management, SEO, video, and email marketing.</p>
<p>I rarely leave home and say <a href="https://olega.org/n">no to all invitations and requests</a>.</p>

	<br>
<p>I recently finished two 100+ KM audax rides.</p>
<p>I'm preparing for my first Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu competition.</p>
<p>I'm trying to lose 10lbs to meet the weight requirement.</p>
<p>I plan to lose weight by being mindful of my calories through the use of the Carrot app, riding my bike, and following a combination of the slow-carb and carnivore diet.</p>
<p>I enjoy thinking about and writing about strategies as I work on Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring suite and reflect on Josh Waitzkin's The Art of Learning.</p>
<p>I share my ideas in my <a href="https://sendfox.com/kevinolega">email newsletter</a> and <a href="https://minimalchanges.com">Minimal Changes blog</a>. I write about my experiences and thoughts on productivity, personal finance, and health.</p><p>I hang out with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqF7xlBlPSm/">Fluffy</a>,
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/">Kuromi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXO3HjyBQAz/"> Yuki</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIfQyrH9lS/">Missy</a>, my friend's dog.</p>
<p>I'm grateful I get to work from home.</p>
<p>I spend my free time <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">blogging</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikZWBgSuOOxXMjaD3">drawing</a>.</p>
<p>I avoid eating out, consuming carbs, sugar, and eat mostly 
<a href="http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/">meat and eggs</a>.</p>
<p>I geek out on anime, manga, and J-pop idols.</p>

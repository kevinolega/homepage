### work

I do project management for a US-based web design firm.

I operate from Manila, Quezon City and Parañaque City.

I write articles for different fitness, productivity, education, financial and creativity blogs.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals. [This picture represents my tasks and commitments at the moment.][1]

### projects

I write [job hunting tips for aspiring BPO workers][2] and occasionally teach English.

I'm attempting to declutter and [sell all of my possessions on my online store][3].

### personal

I'm preparing for a [local bike event][4] this November 2018.

[I have a dog now][5] and I'm learning how to fit caring for my pet into my schedule.

I spend most of my free time cycling, [CrossFit][6], [blogging][7], [drawing][8] and tinkering with tech.

I geek out on almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[I moved my recommendations to its own page.][9]

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers’ /now page][10] movement. Check it out at [nownownow.com][11].

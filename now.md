### work

I do project management work for a US based web design firm.

I'm currently operating from Manila, Quezon City and Parañaque City.

I write articles for different fitness, productivity, education, financial and creativity blogs.

I'm currently not accepting work and business proposals. [Here's a picture that represents the number of commitments on my plate at the moment.][1]

### projects

I write [job hunting tips for aspiring BPO workers][2] and occasionally teach English.

I'm trying to get to minimal by attempting to [sell all of my possessions on my online store][3].

### personal

I'm preparing for a [local bike event][4] this November 2018.

[I have a dog now][5] and I'm learning how to fit caring for my pet into my schedule.

I spend most of my free time cycling, [CrossFit][6], blogging, [drawing][7] and tinkering with tech.

I buy way more notebooks and pens than I should.

I geek out on almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[I moved my recommendations to its own page.][8]

This page is inspired by [Derek Sivers’ /now page][9] movement. Check it out at [nownownow.com][10].

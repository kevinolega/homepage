### work

I manage projects for a US-based web design and development company.

I also manage marketing projects for a career and HR consulting business.

I'm processing different paperwork for local business clients.

[I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals](https://kevinolega.com/n/).

I am grateful I get to work from home. 

I operate from Parañaque City.

My website is the definitive source of information about me and the work I'm doing.


### projects

I'm [writing my second book](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/books). PROGRESS: 87% done.

I [sell English lessons](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/promos/) and write [career advice for BPO workers][1] and  as part of my community service.

My main focus is on keeping my job and writing my book so most of the things that I do are paused.

I rarely leave the house and [I say no to most invitations and requests](https://kevinolega.com/n).

## paused


These are my usual activities and I'll continue after I'm done with the book:

I'm often writing and reflecting on my journal.

I'm learning how to edit photos and videos.

I'm tinkering with website code.


### fitness

Since the Covid-19 lockdown I've been doing [Tabata exercises](https://minimalchanges.com/tabata) at 60-70% of my capacity for about 30 minutes to develop my exercise consistency.

I recently purchased a barbell and squat rack so I follow a 5 x 5 protocol for presses, squats and deadlifts.

### personal

[My dog][4] is [now a father](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/) and I'm now caring two pets as part of my schedule.

I'm renting a small apartment that doubles as an office and exercise space.

I spend my free time [cycling][5], [blogging][7] and [drawing][8].

I avoid consuming carbs, sugar and eat mostly [beef and eggs][9].

I geek out on anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[Stay in touch with me by joining my personal mailing list.][10]

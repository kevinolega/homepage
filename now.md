<h3>work</h3>
<p>I work as a digital project manager. I oversee the creation and development of websites and digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><a href="https://olega.org/n/">I'm not accepting additional work and business proposals</a>.</p>

<h3>projects</h3>
<p>I write for <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a>. I share lessons and videos about communication skills and customer service to help low-income Filipinos qualify for higher-paying jobs.</p>
<p>I'm working on improving my skills in project management, SEO, video, and email marketing.</p>
<p>I'm on a journey to achieve <a href="https://sive.rs/ti">tech independence</a>, a state where I control and manage my own digital information. This involves migrating my data away from cloud-based services such as Simplenote, Evernote, Dropbox, iCloud, and Google's servers.</p>

<h3>personal</h3>
<p>I rarely leave home and say <a href="https://olega.org/n">no to all invitations and requests</a>.</p>
<p>I spend my free time <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">blogging</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikZWBgSuOOxXMjaD3">drawing</a>.</p>
<p>I share my ideas in my <a href="https://sendfox.com/kevinolega">email newsletter</a> and <a href="https://minimalchanges.com">Minimal Changes blog</a>. I write about my experiences and thoughts on productivity, personal finance, and health.</p>
<p>I take care of nine adorable rescue dogs.</p>
<p>I hang out with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqF7xlBlPSm/">Fluffy</a>,
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/">Kuromi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXO3HjyBQAz/"> Yuki</a>, Bella, Fidel, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIfQyrH9lS/">Missy</a>, my friend's dog.</p>
<p>I practice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olegajitsu/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> twice a week and recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqj-VEzpwN4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">took home two silver medals</a> in the Asian Jiu-Jitsu Federation Masters 2 middle-heavy and open weight division.</p>
<p>I follow a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet to maintain my muscle mass and meet Jiu-Jitsu competition weight requirements.</p>
<p>I avoid eating out, consuming carbs, sugar, and eat mostly meat and eggs.</p>
<p>I recently participated in two long-distance cycling events, riding over 100 km in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClySU4VJMqb/">Subic</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXyuP_B1YW/">Batangas</a>.</p>
<p>I geek out on anime, manga, and J-pop idols.</p>

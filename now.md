### work

I manage projects for a US-based career and HR consulting business.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals. [This picture represents my tasks and commitments at the moment.][1]

I am grateful I get to work from home. 

I operate from Parañaque City.

### projects

I write [career advice for BPO workers][2] as part of my community service.

I'm attempting to declutter and [sell all of my possessions on my online store][3].

A few months ago, I bought a bunch of books and access to online courses that include copywriting, email marketing, drawing and web design. I'm trying to study all the material.

[I sell English activities and phone coaching](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/6WEL250/).

### fitness

Since the Covid-19 lockdown I've been doing [Tabata exercises](https://minimalchanges.com/tabata) to develop my exercise consistency.

### personal

[My dog][4] is [now a father](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/) and I'm learning how to fit caring for my two pets into my schedule.

A few years ago I found myself distracted and began renting an office and paid for a gym membership to train.

This year, I decided to rent a bigger place that will allow me to use one of the rooms as an office and has enough space to exercise in.

I spend my free time [cycling][5], [CrossFit][6], [blogging][7], [drawing][8] and learning how to make meditation a daily practice.

I'm trying to cut my carb and sugar intake and eat mostly a [Carnivore Diet][9] and only eat beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood.

I geek out on pens, bikes, tech, fitness, philosophy, and Japanese anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[Stay in touch with me by joining my personal mailing list.][10]

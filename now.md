### work

I manage projects for a US-based web design firm and a career transition consulting business.

I'm currently not accepting additional work and business proposals. [This picture represents my tasks and commitments at the moment.][1]

I operate from Parañaque City.

### projects

I write [career advice for BPO workers][2] as part of my community service.

I'm attempting to declutter and [sell all of my possessions on my online store][3].

A few weeks ago, I bought access to a bunch of books and online courses including copywriting, email marketing, drawing and web design. I'm trying to study all the material.

### personal

[I have a dog now][4] and I'm learning how to fit caring for my pet into my schedule.

I spend most of my free time [cycling][5], [CrossFit][6], [blogging][7], [drawing][8] and learning how to make meditation a daily practice.

I'm trying to cut my carb and sugar intake and eat mostly a [Carnivore Diet][9] and only eat beef, lamb, pork, chicken and seafood.

I geek out on pens, bikes, tech, fitness, philosophy, and almost anything Japanese including anime, manga and J-pop idols.

[Stay in touch with me by joining my personal mailing list.][10]

<h3>work</h3>
<p>I work as a digital project manager. I oversee the creation and development of websites and digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><a href="https://olega.org/n/">I'm not accepting additional work and business proposals</a>.</p>
<h3>projects</h3>
<p>I created <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a> with the mission of helping low-income Filipinos acquire basic job skills and become financially secure. Through the website and video tutorials, I provide comprehensive training in communication and customer service, preparing students to qualify for high-paying jobs. In addition, I offer personalized mentoring to dedicated students, helping them achieve their career goals.</p>
<p>I'm working on improving my skills in project management, SEO, video, and email marketing.</p>
<p>I rarely leave home and say <a href="https://olega.org/n">no to all invitations and requests</a>.</p>

<h3>personal</h3>

<p>I'm working on completing Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring suite and reflecting on Josh Waitzkin's The Art of Learning.</p>
<p>I share my ideas in my <a href="https://sendfox.com/kevinolega">email newsletter</a> and <a href="https://minimalchanges.com">Minimal Changes blog</a>. I write about my experiences and thoughts on productivity, personal finance, and health.</p>
<p>I take care of four adorable rescue dogs.</p>
<p>I hang out with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqF7xlBlPSm/">Fluffy</a>,
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/">Kuromi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXO3HjyBQAz/"> Yuki</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIfQyrH9lS/">Missy</a>, my friend's dog.</p>
<p>I practice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olegajitsu/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> twice a week and recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqj-VEzpwN4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">took home two silver medals</a> in the Asian Jiu-Jitsu Federation Masters 2 middle-heavy and open weight division.</p>
<p>I'm grateful I get to work from home.</p>
<p>I spend my free time <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">blogging</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikZWBgSuOOxXMjaD3">drawing</a>.</p>
<p>I follow a low-carb, high-protein diet to maintain my muscle mass and meet Jiu-Jitsu competition weight requirements.</p>
<p>I avoid eating out, consuming carbs, sugar, and eat mostly 
<a href="http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/">meat and eggs</a>.</p>
<p>I geek out on anime, manga, and J-pop idols.</p>

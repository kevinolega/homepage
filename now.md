<h3>work</h3>
<p>I work as a digital project manager, overseeing the creation and development of websites and digital marketing campaigns. My role includes optimizing email newsletters, social media, and video services to grow audiences, conducting SEO keyword research, and planning and creating content to enhance search engine rankings.</p>
<p><a href="https://olega.org/n/">I'm not accepting additional work and business proposals</a>.</p>
<h3>projects</h3>
<p>I created <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a> with the mission of helping low-income Filipinos acquire basic job skills and become financially secure. Through the website and video tutorials, I provide comprehensive training in communication and customer service, preparing students to qualify for high-paying jobs. In addition, I offer personalized mentoring to dedicated students, helping them achieve their career goals.</p>
<p>I'm working on improving my skills in project management, SEO, video, and email marketing.</p>
<p>I rarely leave home and say <a href="https://olega.org/n">no to all invitations and requests</a>.</p>
<h3>fitness</h3>
<p>I'm a fitness enthusiast who loves CrossFit, cycling and martial arts.</p>

<p>I walk my dogs for about an hour daily.</p>
<p>I follow a 5x5 strength protocol for squats, presses, and deadlifts. I also practice kettlebell swings and turkish getups.</p>
<p>I slowly do bodyweight exercises like <a href="https://minimalchanges.com/grapplerfit">burpees, air squats, pull ups, and toes to bar</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy riding my bike around the city and have participated in long-distance cycling events, riding over 100km in Subic and Batangas.</p>
<p>I practice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olegajitsu/">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> twice a week and recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqj-VEzpwN4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">took home two silver medals</a> in the Asian Jiu-Jitsu Federation Masters 2 middle-heavy and open weight division.</p>
<p>I follow a low-carb, high-protein diet to maintain my muscle mass and meet Jiu-Jitsu competition weight requirements.</p>

<p>Living like a minimalist, I focus on owning less and making sure every item I own fits my strategy and preferred lifestyle.</p>
<p>I enjoy thinking about and writing about strategies as I work on Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring suite and reflect on Josh Waitzkin's The Art of Learning.</p>
<p>I share my ideas in my <a href="https://sendfox.com/kevinolega">email newsletter</a> and <a href="https://minimalchanges.com">Minimal Changes blog</a>. I write about my experiences and thoughts on productivity, personal finance, and health.</p>
<p>I take care of four adorable rescue dogs.</p>
<p>I hang out with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqF7xlBlPSm/">Fluffy</a>,
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gpVKEn4ZS/">Kuromi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXO3HjyBQAz/"> Yuki</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNIfQyrH9lS/">Missy</a>, my friend's dog.</p>
<p>I'm grateful I get to work from home.</p>
<p>I spend my free time <a href="http://minimalchanges.com">blogging</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikZWBgSuOOxXMjaD3">drawing</a>.</p>
<p>I avoid eating out, consuming carbs, sugar, and eat mostly 
<a href="http://philippineislandliving.com/carnivore-diet-philippines-first-attempt/">meat and eggs</a>.</p>
<p>I geek out on anime, manga, and J-pop idols.</p>
